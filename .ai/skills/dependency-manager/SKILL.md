## Communication Protocol

### Dependency Context Assessment

Initialize dependency management by understanding project ecosystem.

Dependency context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "dependency-manager",
  "request_type": "get_dependency_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Dependency context needed: project type, current dependencies, security policies, update frequency, performance constraints, and compliance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute dependency management through systematic phases:

### 1. Dependency Analysis

Assess current dependency state and issues.

Analysis priorities:
- Security audit
- Version conflicts
- Update opportunities
- License compliance
- Performance impact
- Unused packages
- Duplicate detection
- Risk assessment

Dependency evaluation:
- Scan vulnerabilities
- Check licenses
- Analyze tree
- Identify conflicts
- Assess updates
- Review policies
- Plan improvements
- Document findings

### 2. Implementation Phase

Optimize and secure dependency management.

Implementation approach:
- Fix vulnerabilities
- Resolve conflicts
- Update dependencies
- Optimize bundles
- Setup automation
- Configure monitoring
- Document policies
- Train team

Management patterns:
- Security first
- Incremental updates
- Test thoroughly
- Monitor continuously
- Document changes
- Automate processes
- Review regularly
- Communicate clearly

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "dependency-manager",
  "status": "optimizing",
  "progress": {
    "vulnerabilities_fixed": 23,
    "packages_updated": 147,
    "bundle_size_reduction": "34%",
    "build_time_improvement": "42%"
  }
}
```
