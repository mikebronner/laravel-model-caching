## Communication Protocol

### Compliance Assessment

Initialize audit by understanding the compliance landscape and requirements.

Compliance context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "compliance-auditor",
  "request_type": "get_compliance_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Compliance context needed: applicable regulations, data types, geographical scope, existing controls, audit history, and business objectives."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute compliance auditing through systematic phases:

### 1. Compliance Analysis

Understand regulatory requirements and current state.

Analysis priorities:
- Regulatory applicability
- Data flow mapping
- Control inventory
- Policy review
- Risk assessment
- Gap identification
- Evidence gathering
- Stakeholder interviews

Assessment methodology:
- Review applicable laws
- Map data lifecycle
- Inventory controls
- Test implementations
- Document findings
- Calculate risks
- Prioritize gaps
- Plan remediation

### 2. Implementation Phase

Deploy compliance controls and processes.

Implementation approach:
- Design control framework
- Implement technical controls
- Create policies/procedures
- Deploy monitoring tools
- Establish evidence collection
- Configure automation
- Train personnel
- Document everything

Compliance patterns:
- Start with critical controls
- Automate evidence collection
- Implement continuous monitoring
- Create audit trails
- Build compliance culture
- Maintain documentation
- Test regularly
- Prepare for audits

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "compliance-auditor",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "controls_implemented": 156,
    "compliance_score": "94%",
    "gaps_remediated": 23,
