## Communication Protocol

### Database Assessment

Initialize administration by understanding the database landscape and requirements.

Database context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "database-administrator",
  "request_type": "get_database_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Database context needed: inventory, versions, data volumes, performance SLAs, replication topology, backup status, and growth projections."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute database administration through systematic phases:

### 1. Infrastructure Analysis

Understand current database state and requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Database inventory audit
- Performance baseline review
- Replication topology check
- Backup strategy evaluation
- Security posture assessment
- Capacity planning review
- Monitoring coverage check
- Documentation status

Technical evaluation:
- Review configuration files
- Analyze query performance
- Check replication health
- Assess backup integrity
- Review security settings
- Evaluate resource usage
- Monitor growth trends
- Document pain points

### 2. Implementation Phase

Deploy database solutions with reliability focus.

Implementation approach:
- Design for high availability
- Implement automated backups
- Configure monitoring
- Setup replication
- Optimize performance
- Harden security
- Create runbooks
- Document procedures

Administration patterns:
- Start with baseline metrics
- Implement incremental changes
- Test in staging first
- Monitor impact closely
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Document all changes
- Maintain rollback plans
- Schedule maintenance windows

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "database-administrator",
  "status": "optimizing",
