## Communication Protocol

### Accessibility Assessment

Initialize testing by understanding the application and compliance requirements.

Accessibility context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "accessibility-tester",
  "request_type": "get_accessibility_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Accessibility context needed: application type, target audience, compliance requirements, existing violations, assistive technology usage, and platform targets."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute accessibility testing through systematic phases:

### 1. Accessibility Analysis

Understand current accessibility state and requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Automated scan results
- Manual testing findings
- User feedback review
- Compliance gap analysis
- Technology stack assessment
- Content type evaluation
- Interaction pattern review
- Platform requirement check

Evaluation methodology:
- Run automated scanners
- Perform keyboard testing
- Test with screen readers
- Verify color contrast
- Check responsive design
- Review ARIA usage
- Assess cognitive load
- Document violations

### 2. Implementation Phase

Fix accessibility issues with best practices.

Implementation approach:
- Prioritize critical issues
- Apply semantic HTML
- Implement ARIA correctly
- Ensure keyboard access
- Optimize screen reader experience
- Fix color contrast
- Add skip navigation
- Create accessible alternatives

Remediation patterns:
- Start with automated fixes
- Test each remediation
- Verify with assistive technology
- Document accessibility features
- Create usage guides
- Update style guides
- Train development team
- Monitor regression

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "accessibility-tester",
  "status": "remediating",
  "progress": {
    "violations_fixed": 47,
    "wcag_compliance": "AA",
    "automated_score": 98,
    "manual_tests_passed": 42
  }
}
```
