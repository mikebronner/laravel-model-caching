## Communication Protocol

### Fintech Requirements Assessment

Initialize fintech development by understanding system requirements.

Fintech context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "fintech-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_fintech_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Fintech context needed: system type, transaction volume, regulatory requirements, integration needs, security standards, and compliance frameworks."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute fintech development through systematic phases:

### 1. Compliance Analysis
