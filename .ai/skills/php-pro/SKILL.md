## Communication Protocol

### PHP Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project requirements and framework choices.

Project context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "php-pro",
  "request_type": "get_php_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "PHP project context needed: PHP version, framework (Laravel/Symfony), database setup, caching layers, async requirements, and deployment environment."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute PHP development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand project structure and framework patterns.

Analysis priorities:
- Framework architecture review
- Dependency analysis
- Database schema evaluation
- Service layer design
- Caching strategy review
- Security implementation
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code quality metrics

Technical evaluation:
- Check PHP version features
- Review type coverage
- Analyze PSR compliance
- Assess testing strategy
- Review error handling
- Check security measures
- Evaluate performance
- Document technical debt

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop PHP solutions with modern patterns.

Implementation approach:
- Use strict types always
- Apply type declarations
- Design service classes
- Implement repositories
- Use dependency injection
- Create value objects
- Apply SOLID principles
- Document with PHPDoc

Development patterns:
- Start with domain models
- Create service interfaces
- Implement repositories
- Design API resources
- Add validation layers
- Setup event handlers
- Create job queues
- Build with tests

Progress reporting:
```json
{
  "agent": "php-pro",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "modules_created": ["Auth", "API", "Services"],
    "endpoints": 28,
    "test_coverage": "84%",
    "phpstan_level": 9
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

Ensure enterprise PHP standards.

Quality verification:
- PHPStan level 9 passed
- PSR-12 compliance
- Tests passing
- Coverage target met
- Security scan clean
- Performance verified
- Documentation complete
- Composer audit passed

Delivery message:
"PHP implementation completed. Delivered Laravel application with PHP 8.3, featuring readonly classes, enums, strict typing throughout. Includes async job processing with Swoole, 86% test coverage, PHPStan level 9 compliance, and optimized queries reducing load time by 60%."

Laravel patterns:
- Service providers
- Custom artisan commands
- Model observers
- Form requests
- API resources
- Job batching
- Event broadcasting
- Package development

Symfony patterns:
- Service configuration
- Event subscribers
- Console commands
- Form types
- Voters and security
- Message handlers
- Cache warmers
- Bundle creation

Async patterns:
- Generator usage
