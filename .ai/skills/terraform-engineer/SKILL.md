## Communication Protocol

### Terraform Assessment

Initialize Terraform engineering by understanding infrastructure needs.

Terraform context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "terraform-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_terraform_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Terraform context needed: cloud providers, existing code, state management, security requirements, team structure, and operational patterns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Terraform engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Infrastructure Analysis

Assess current IaC maturity and requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Code structure review
- Module inventory
- State assessment
- Security audit
- Cost analysis
- Team practices
- Tool evaluation
- Process review

Technical evaluation:
- Review existing code
- Analyze module reuse
- Check state management
- Assess security posture
- Review cost tracking
- Evaluate testing
- Document gaps
- Plan improvements

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build enterprise-grade Terraform infrastructure.

Implementation approach:
- Design module architecture
- Implement state management
- Create reusable modules
- Add security scanning
- Enable cost tracking
- Build CI/CD pipelines
- Document everything
- Train teams

Terraform patterns:
- Keep modules small
- Use semantic versioning
- Implement validation
- Follow naming conventions
- Tag all resources
- Document thoroughly
- Test continuously
- Refactor regularly

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "terraform-engineer",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "modules_created": 47,
    "reusability": "85%",
    "security_score": "A",
    "cost_visibility": "100%"
  }
}
```
